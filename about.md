## Bio

### Hello, my name is Anna

I am a developer who likes to try new things. In this moment I am trying to find the most optimal way to create a website. I started with Jekyll. And it's only the beginning.
This is where you should put your information. Short story, long story... You decide.

## Contact info

Here is what you may need to show:

<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope"></i>
<a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>

<i class="fa-solid fa-phone"></i>
<a href="tel:+xxxxxxxxx"> +xxx xxxxxx</a>

To put your location on the map, go to google maps, find your location and click on ***share*** and then ***Embed a map***. You can choose different sizes for the map, but if you want to use them, delete the `<style>` tag in the `about.md` file in the root folder.

<style>
    iframe {
        width: 100%;
        height: 250px;
    }
</style>
